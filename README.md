# Drunk Detector

This project aims to detect if someone is drunk or sober through computer vision.

## Getting started

Make sure you have installed poetry, set it up as your environment, and run the following 
commands before anything else:

```bash
poetry lock
poetry install
poetry shell
```

After running these commands, you should enter a new shell with all the project dependencies 
installed.
